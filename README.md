# Weekly Shopping Manager 

A simple Python project to practice **lists, dictionaries, loops, and conditionals** while managing a weekly shopping list.  
This is my **first project on GitHub**, created to document my learning journey in Python.

## Description 
The program allows the user to:
- Add products to a shopping list.
- Assign a price to each product.
- Display the complete list with costs.
- Calculate the total expense.
- Show a warning message if the total exceeds a certain limit (e.g. 100£).

This project is not meant to be "perfect software", but a **practical exercise** to learn programming concepts step by step.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tommy-IA/weekly-shopping-manager.git

Open the project folder.

Run the program with:

'python main.py'

## Example of use

Welcome, start adding new product to the list:

| Product   | Price |
|-----------|-------|
| Bread     | 1.20 £|
| Milk      | 0.99 £|
| Eggs      | 2.50 £|

Total: 4.69 £

## What I learned
Using lists and dictionaries in Python.

Working with for loops to iterate over items.

Applying if conditions to create simple logic (like discounts or warnings).

The basics of GitHub workflow: commits, README, .gitignore.

## Next improvements
Add discounts for students and under 18.

Allow the user to remove products already added.

Save the shopping list to a .txt file and reload it later.
